"""Turn a domain pack into a corpus of controlled documents.

Design note
-----------
The generator writes Markdown with a YAML-ish control block at the top. That
choice is deliberate: the downstream index needs stable document → section →
paragraph addressing so a citation can point at "document X, section Y,
paragraph 3", and Markdown headings give that for free without a parser.

Each document is assembled as:

    control header block      (real document-management apparatus)
    body sections             (canonical order from the pack's DocType)
    definitions and acronyms  (drawn from the pack lexicon)
    references                (cross-links to sibling documents — graph edges)
    revision history          (a plausible amendment trail)
    approval                  (role titles from the pack)

The cross-reference section is what makes the corpus a *fabric* rather than a
pile: it is the source of most graph edges, and it is what lets the knowledge
health scorer detect orphan documents that nothing else cites.
